# Graph Theory: Applications in Modern Navigation Systems

### 1. Project Overview
Investigated the mathematical foundations of Google Maps, specifically how Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory are used to solve complex real-world routing, traffic forecasting, and scheduling problems.

### 2. Dataset
Analyzed structural data and algorithmic frameworks from established mathematical literature (Bondy & Murty, Diestel) and technical case studies regarding Google Maps' implementation of navigation services.

### 3. Approach
* **Algorithmic Analysis:** Evaluated the application of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **A* (A-star)** for shortest-path calculations in dynamic networks.
* **Modeling:** Utilized vertices (nodes) to represent locations and edges (connections) to model road networks, incorporating weights for traffic and weather conditions.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Research:** Linked graph theory principles to social media marketing (community structure analysis) and airline scheduling (resource allocation).

### 4. Results
* **Insights:** Demonstrated how graph theory transforms simple maps into intelligent systems capable of real-time traffic updates and user-customized routing (e.g., eco-friendly paths).
* **Optimization:** Explained how algorithmic efficiency directly impacts the scalability of navigation services used by billions of people.

### 5. Key Learnings
This project bridged the gap between abstract mathematics and production-level software. I learned that "optimal" is subjective, in a navigation system, the shortest path isn't always the fastest. I gained a deep understanding of how to translate real-world constraints (like traffic congestion or road blocks) into mathematical weights within a graph, a skill that is essential for building efficient backends and optimization engines.
